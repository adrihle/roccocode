## ✨ Introduction
Welcome to **ROCCO.CODE**, a finely tuned Neovim configuration built for those who demand speed, flexibility, and an optimized workflow. Designed with **Lua and Lazy.nvim**, this setup is engineered to make web development (and your terminal life) faster, smoother, and just plain badass. 

## 💡 The Why
Great tools come from necessity. **ROCCO.CODE** wasn’t built overnight—it’s a reflection of a journey, of refining, tweaking, and pushing through long nights of coding. It’s here to do one thing: **help developers focus on what truly matters—writing great code without friction**. 

This project is a nod to persistence, to the ones who keep building, even when things get tough. Inspired by Rocco, my steadfast companion through thick and thin, this is for those who embrace the grind and come out stronger. 

## 🚀 Features
✅ **Supercharged Neovim for Web Development**  
✅ **Lightning-fast startup**—because patience is overrated  
✅ **Lazy.nvim** for streamlined plugin management  
✅ **Intuitive keybindings**—your fingers will thank you  
✅ **SSH & terminal integrations**—because we do things remotely too  
✅ **Enhanced LSP, Treesitter & Autocomplete**  
✅ **A sleek UI that doesn’t distract you from the code**  

## 📦 Installation
Getting started is a breeze:

```sh
# Backup your existing config (if needed)
